# Lab: locks
In this lab you'll gain experience in re-designing code to increase parallelism. A common symptom of poor parallelism on multi-core machines is high lock contention. Improving parallelism often involves changing both data structures and locking strategies in order to reduce contention. You'll do this for the xv6 memory allocator and block cache.

# Memory allocator (moderate)

The program `user/kalloctest` stresses xv6's memory allocator: three processes grow and shrink their address spaces, resulting in many calls to kalloc and kfree. `kalloc` and `kfree` obtain `kmem.lock`. kalloctest prints (as "#fetch-and-add") the number of loop iterations in acquire due to attempts to acquire a lock that another core already holds, for the kmem lock and a few other locks. The number of loop iterations in acquire is a rough measure of lock contention. The output of kalloctest looks similar to this before you complete the lab:


```bash
$ kalloctest
start test1
test1 results:
--- lock kmem/bcache stats
lock: kmem: #fetch-and-add 13449 #acquire() 433086
lock: bcache: #fetch-and-add 0 #acquire() 2106
--- top 5 contended locks:
lock: proc: #fetch-and-add 35614 #acquire() 303499
lock: proc: #fetch-and-add 28073 #acquire() 303501
lock: proc: #fetch-and-add 21103 #acquire() 303545
lock: virtio_disk: #fetch-and-add 15129 #acquire() 126
lock: kmem: #fetch-and-add 13449 #acquire() 433086
tot= 13449
test1 FAIL
start test2
total free number of pages: 32499 (out of 32768)
.....
test2 OK

```


`acquire` maintains, for each lock, the count of calls to acquire for that lock, and the number of times the loop in acquire tried but failed to set the lock. kalloctest calls a system call that causes the kernel to print those counts for the kmem and bcache locks (which are the focus of this lab) and for the 5 most contended locks. If there is lock contention the number of acquire loop iterations will be large. The system call returns the sum of the number of loop iterations for the kmem and bcache locks.

For this lab, you must use a dedicated unloaded machine with multiple cores. If you use a machine that is doing other things, the counts that kalloctest prints will be nonsense. You can use a dedicated Athena workstation, or your own laptop, but don't use a dialup machine.

The root cause of lock contention in `kalloctest` is that `kalloc()` has a single free list, protected by a single lock. To remove lock contention, you will have to redesign the memory allocator to avoid a single lock and list. 

The basic idea is to maintain a free list per CPU, each list with its own lock. Allocations and frees on different CPUs can run in parallel, because each CPU will operate on a different list. The main challenge will be to deal with the case in which one CPU's free list is empty, but another CPU's list has free memory; in that case, the one CPU must "steal" part of the other CPU's free list. Stealing may introduce lock contention, but that will hopefully be infrequent.


Your job is to implement per-CPU freelists, and stealing when a CPU's free list is empty. You must give all of your locks names that start with "kmem". That is, you should call `initlock` for each of your locks, and pass a name that starts with "kmem". 

## Test
Run kalloctest to see if your implementation has reduced lock contention. To check that it can still allocate all of memory, run `usertests sbrkmuch`. Your output will look similar to that shown below, with much-reduced contention in total on kmem locks, although the specific numbers will differ. Make sure all tests in usertests pass. make grade should say that the kalloctests pass.

```bash

$ kalloctest
start test1
test1 results:
--- lock kmem/bcache stats
lock: kmem: #fetch-and-add 0 #acquire() 42843
lock: kmem: #fetch-and-add 0 #acquire() 198674

lock: proc: #fetch-and-add 4168 #acquire() 117316

```


## Some hints:
- You can use the constant `NCPU` from `kernel/param.h`
- Let `freerange` give all free memory to the CPU running freerange.
- The function `cpuid` returns the current core number, but it's only safe to call it and use its result when interrupts are turned off. You should use `push_off()` and `pop_off()` to turn interrupts off and on.
- Have a look at the `snprintf` function in `kernel/sprintf.c` for string formatting ideas. It is OK to just name all locks "kmem" though.

## Debug 

In xv6 terms:
- #acquire() → total times acquire(lock) was called
- #fetch-and-add → how many times a CPU had to spin because the lock was already held
- Spin count ≈ contention
Zero spin means: every acquire succeeded immediately.

# Buffer cache (hard)
This half of the assignment is independent from the first half; you can work on this half (and pass the tests) whether or not you have completed the first half.

If multiple processes use the file system intensively, they will likely contend for `bcache.lock`, which protects the disk block cache in `kernel/bio.`c. 
`bcachetest` creates several processes that repeatedly read different files in order to generate contention on `bcache.lock`; its output looks like this (before you complete this lab):


```bash

$ bcachetest
start test0
test0 results:
--- lock kmem/bcache stats
lock: kmem: #fetch-and-add 0 #acquire() 33035
lock: bcache: #fetch-and-add 16142 #acquire() 65978

You will likely see different output, but the number of acquire loop iterations for the `bcache` lock will be high. If you look at the code in `kernel/bio.c`, you'll see that `bcache.lock` protects the list of cached block buffers, the reference count (`b->refcnt`) in each block buffer, and the identities of the cached blocks (`b->dev` and `b->blockno`).


Modify the block cache so that the number of acquire loop iterations for all locks in the bcache is close to zero when running `bcachetest`. Ideally the sum of the counts for all locks involved in the block cache should be zero, but it's OK if the sum is less than 500. Modify `bget` and `brelse` so that concurrent lookups and releases for different blocks that are in the bcache are unlikely to conflict on locks (e.g., don't all have to wait for bcache.lock). You must maintain the invariant that at most one copy of each block is cached. 

## Test
When you are done, your output should be similar to that shown below (though not identical). Make sure `usertests` still passes. make grade should pass all tests when you are done.

Please give all of your locks names that start with "bcache". That is, you should call `initlock` for each of your locks, and pass a name that starts with "bcache".

Reducing contention in the block cache is more tricky than for `kalloc`, because `bcache` buffers are truly shared among processes (and thus CPUs). For kalloc, one could eliminate most contention by giving each CPU its own allocator; that won't work for the block cache. We suggest you look up block numbers in the cache with a hash table that has a lock per hash bucket.

There are some circumstances in which it's OK if your solution has lock conflicts:
- When two processes concurrently use the same block number. bcachetest test0 doesn't ever do this.
- When two processes concurrently miss in the cache, and need to find an unused block to replace. bcachetest test0 doesn't ever do this.
- When two processes concurrently use blocks that conflict in whatever scheme you use to partition the blocks and locks; for example, if two processes use blocks whose block numbers hash to the same slot in a hash table. bcachetest test0 might do this, depending on your design, but you should try to adjust your scheme's details to avoid conflicts (e.g., change the size of your hash table).
bcachetest's test1 uses more distinct blocks than there are buffers, and exercises lots of file system code paths.

## hints
Here are some hints:

- Read the description of the block cache in the xv6 book (Section 8.1-8.3).
- It is OK to use a fixed number of buckets and not resize the hash table dynamically. Use a prime number of buckets (e.g., 13) to reduce the likelihood of hashing conflicts.
- Searching in the hash table for a buffer and allocating an entry for that buffer when the buffer is not found must be atomic.
- Remove the list of all buffers (bcache.head etc.) and instead time-stamp buffers using the time of their last use (i.e., using ticks in kernel/trap.c). With this change brelse doesn't need to acquire the bcache lock, and bget can select the least-recently used block based on the time-stamps.
I- t is OK to serialize eviction in bget (i.e., the part of bget that selects a buffer to re-use when a lookup misses in the cache).
- Your solution might need to hold two locks in some cases; for example, during eviction you may need to hold the bcache lock and a lock per bucket. Make sure you avoid deadlock.

- When replacing a block, you might move a struct buf from one bucket to another bucket, because the new block hashes to a different bucket. You might have a tricky case: the new block might hash to the same bucket as the old block. Make sure you avoid deadlock in that case.

- Some debugging tips: implement bucket locks but leave the global bcache.lock acquire/release at the beginning/end of bget to serialize the code. Once you are sure it is correct without race conditions, remove the global locks and deal with concurrency issues. You can also run make CPUS=1 qemu to test with one core.
