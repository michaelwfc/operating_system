/**Your goal is to use pipe and fork to set up the pipeline. 
 * The first process feeds the numbers 2 through 35 into the pipeline. 
 * For each prime number, you will arrange to create one process that reads from its left neighbor over a pipe and writes to its right neighbor over another pipe. 
 * Since xv6 has limited number of file descriptors and processes, the first process can stop at 35.
 * 
1. main process:
- create the first pipe pipe1
- writes 2..35 into pipe1.
- Closes the write end and forks the first prime filter process.

2. Prime filter process
- Reads the first number from the pipe â†’ this is the prime.
- Prints it.
- Creates a new pipe for the next process.
- Filters out numbers divisible by this prime and writes the rest into the new pipe.
- Forks the next prime filter process and passes the new pipe to it.
- This repeats until no more numbers remain.
